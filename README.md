# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

For this analysis, we were asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type with Python and Pandas. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we were to create a multiple-line graph that showed the total weekly fares for each city type. Using this information, a detailed report was created that summarized how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
